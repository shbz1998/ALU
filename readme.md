# ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT
## SHAHBAZ HASSAN KHAN MALIK

This is an Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations between A and B.

The ALU has Overflow, Negative, Zero and Carry flags. These flags are to hold their values 
between operations that update them. Overflow and Carry are only updated on arithmetic 
(addition or subtraction) operations. Both arithmetic and Boolean operations will update the 
other two flags.  

Both exhaustive and non-exhaustive test benches are provived in this repo.
